% 2D Steady-State Conduction in a Copper Plate
% Using Finite Difference Method

% Define parameters
L = 0.1; % Length of the plate (in meters)
W = 0.1; % Width of the plate (in meters)
T_init = 100; % Initial temperature (in degrees Celsius)
T_boundary = 0; % Temperature at boundaries (in degrees Celsius)
thermal_conductivity = 385; % Thermal conductivity of copper (in W/(m*K))
grid_points = 50; % Number of grid points in each dimension

% Discretize the plate
dx = L / (grid_points - 1);
dy = W / (grid_points - 1);

% Initialize temperature matrix
T = T_init * ones(grid_points, grid_points);

% Set boundary conditions
T(:, 1) = T_boundary;
T(:, end) = T_boundary;
T(1, :) = T_boundary;
T(end, :) = T_boundary;

% Perform iterative solution
num_iterations = 1000; % Number of iterations
for iter = 1:num_iterations
    T_new = T;
    for i = 2:(grid_points - 1)
        for j = 2:(grid_points - 1)
            % Apply finite difference formula
            T_new(i, j) = (T(i+1, j) + T(i-1, j) + T(i, j+1) + T(i, j-1)) / 4;
        end
    end
    T = T_new;
end
